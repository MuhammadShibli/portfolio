# Muhammad Shibli Mansuri
**Game Designer | Technical Designer | Game Developer**

Hi there! I'm Muhammad Shibli Mansuri, a game designer who’s been passionate about games and their impact for as long as I can remember. With over a decade of experience, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects—from educational games that help kids learn science, to hypercasual mobile games that bring fun to millions of players.

I love the challenge of designing engaging player experiences, whether that’s through crafting detailed level designs, creating balanced economy systems, or leading a talented team to bring an idea to life. I believe that games are a unique medium that can both entertain and educate, and I’ve always been excited to explore that intersection.

Throughout my journey, I've worked with some amazing people and studios, including projects that made it to the top of the charts in the app store. I’m always looking for new challenges where I can keep learning, collaborating, and pushing creative boundaries. If you’re curious about my work or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
